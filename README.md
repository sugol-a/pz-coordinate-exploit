# Project Zomboid player location exploit

**This has been patched!**

---

In early 2022, there was a bug in Project Zomboid which caused the server to
leak a player's coordinates to all other clients when the player disconnected
from the server. This is a script I wrote to play around with the bug --- for
educational purposes only, of course :)
